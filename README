Del 4 - The B-Tree - README file

VERSION- 1.0
VERSION HISTORY-
1. Version 1.0: initial release

STUB DETAILS-

Deliverable 4 specification can be found in del4.pdf.

* Files:

Makefile
README
btree.h              -- B-Tree class header
btree.tem            -- B-Tree class implementation
btree_iterator.h     -- B-Tree iterator class header
btree_iterator.tem   -- B-Tree iterator class implementation
del4_v10.pdf         -- specification
test01.cpp           -- testing files
test02.cpp
test02.out           -- sample output
test03.cpp
test03.out
twl.txt              -- input data

Please note that `test01.cpp' contains various bits and pieces of testing code. 
You should adapt it as you see fit. You will need to produce many more test 
files to become confident your implementation is correct.

* Your task:

Implement the missing code to produce a working implementation of the
B-Tree class and associated iterator class.

You will be submitting four files: btree.h, btree.tem, btree_iterator.h 
and btree_iterator.tem. 
None of these files should contain a `main' function!

They will be compiled with a test file containing the `main' function and 
the test code. The Makefile will be similar to the one provided and the test
harnesses similar to the test files provided.

If a binary is successfully created then the binary will be run and you 
will receive the marks if it produces the correct output.
 
Good luck!
